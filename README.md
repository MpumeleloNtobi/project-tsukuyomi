# Project Tsukuyomi
Group 35 Software Design Project 2025
> Project ‚úçÔ∏è Tsukiyomi üë∫‚Äîwhere the blind lead the blind to light, and reality is nothing more than a fragile lie waiting to be shattered.
> Here, time bends, flesh withers, and the mind crumbles under the weight of an eternity spent in agony, all in the name of a twisted salvation.
> A world where suffering is infinite, yet mercy is an illusion‚Äîwhere the only escape is to accept the dream or be consumed by the nightmare.
> This is the dawn of the eternal moon‚Ä¶ and the dusk of free will üåôüî•.
> 
> None of us has the skillset but we all have the Work ethic and that will be more than enough.....ü§ù

## 1 Naming Convention
Please try to use short and descriptive names as far as practically possible

### Definitions
- Kabab-case: lowercase letters with hyphenation between words e.g. `variable-name`
- camelCase: the first word is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with a capital letter e.g. `variableName`
- PascalCase: each word starts with a capital letter and no separators are used e.g. `VariableName`

### Directories
- Kabab-case
- Examples: `assets`, `root-directory`, `components`, `user-profiles`

### Files
- Kabab-case:
- Examples:
  - **HTML:** `index.html`, `about-us.html`
  - **CSS:** `main-style.css`, `reset.css`
  - **JavaScript:** `app.js`, `user-profile.js`
  - **Images:** `background-image.png`, `logo.svg`

### HTML
- IDs:
  - Kebab-case
  - Example: `<div id="main-container">`
- Classes:
  - Kabab-case
  - Example: `<div class="nav-item">`

### JavaScript
- Variables:
  - camelCase
  - Examples: `let userProfile;`
- Functions:
  - camelCase
  - Examples: `function fetchData() { ... }` 
- Classes:
  - PascalCase
  - Example: `class UserProfile { ... }`
- Constants:
  - UPPERCASE with underscores between words
  - Example: `const API_URL = 'https://api.example.com';`
- Routes (URLs)
  - Kabab-case
  - Examples:  `/about-us`, `/user-profile`, `/contact-support`

## 2 How to Contribute
Please note that the main branch is protected for security purposes. 
This means that you cannot push changes directly to the main branch. 
Instead, you should create a pull request (PR) to propose and merge your changes. 

Therefore, follow these steps to propose any changes:

### Clone the Repository
  - If you haven‚Äôt already, clone the remote repository: `https://github.com/MpumeleloNtobi/project-tsukuyomi.git`

### Sync the Main Branch
Ensure your local main branch is up to date: `git pull`

### Create a New Branch
You can create and switch to a new branch using one of the following methods:
- Single Command: `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>`
- Separate Commands: `git branch <new-branch-name>` followed by `git checkout <new-branch-name>`

At this point, you are ready to make changes‚Äîwhether modifying existing code, writing new code, adding files, or fixing bugs.

### Stage Your Changes
- Stage all changes in the working directory: `git add .`
- Stage changes in a specific file: `git add <file-name>`
- Stage selected changes in a specific file: `git add -p <file-name>`
- Stage selected changes in the entire working directory: `git add -p`

### Commit Your Changes
- Commit all staged changes: `git commit -m "<commit message>"`
- Alternatively, stage and commit in one command (only works for tracked files): `git commit -am "<commit message>"`

### Push Your Changes
Push your changes to an upstream feature branch. 
- This command creates a new remote branch if it doesn‚Äôt already exist: `git push --set-upstream origin <remote-feature-branch-name>`
- Or equivalently: `git push -u origin <remote-feature-branch-name>`

### Create a Pull Request
On GitHub, create a Pull Request from your feature branch and add at least one reviewer to propose merging your changes into the main branch.

### Review and Merge
- Wait for your changes to be reviewed and approved.
- Once approved, merge the changes into the main branch.
- If there are any merge conflicts, resolve them, then wait for another review before trying again.
