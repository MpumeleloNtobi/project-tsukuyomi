"SD-4","SD Project","Connect GitHub or GitLab","Connect your account to link issues to pull/merge requests and automate your workflow:

* Link Linear issues to pull requests.
* Automatically update an issue's status when PRs are created or merged.
* Connect one or multiple repos.

[Connect GitHub or GitLab â†’](https://linear.app/settings/integrations/github)

## Setup tips

#### How to link a Linear issue to a PR

* **Branch name** (e.g. ""LIN-123"" or ""username/LIN-123""). To quickly copy branch name for an issue to your clipboard, press `Cmd/Ctrl` `Shift` `.`
* **Pull request title** (e.g. ""GitHub Workflow LIN-123"")
* **Pull request description** (e.g. *Fixes LIN-123, Resolves LIN-123*) â€“Â it will not work if entered in commits or comments.

#### When you link a Linear issue to a PR, Linear will:

* Create a link to the PR in the Linear issue.
* Comment on the PR with a link back to the Linear issue.
* Once PR has been opened, Linear will change the status of the issue to ""In Progress"".
* Once PR has been merged, Linear will change the status of the issue as ""Done"".

#### Suggested Workflow

1. Select or create the issue you want to work on next.
2. Open the command menu (`Cmd` `K` on Mac, or `Ctrl` `K` on Windows) and select **Copy git branch name,** or use the shortcut `Cmd/Ctrl` `Shift` `.`
3. This will copy the git branch name to your clipboard (e.g. `username/LIN-123-github-workflow`
4. Paste the branch name to your git checkout command to create a new branch: `git checkout -b username/LIN-123-github-workflow`
5. Make your changes and push the branch to GitHub and open a pull request
6. Once the pull request is open, Linear will comment on the PR and change the issue state to **In Progress***.* 
7. Once the PR merged, Linear will change the status to Done.
